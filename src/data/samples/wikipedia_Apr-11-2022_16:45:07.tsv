Q'orianka Waira Qoiana Kilcher (; born February 11, 1990) is a German-born American-Peruvian actress, singer, and activist.
She played Pocahontas in the 2005 film The New World, and Kaʻiulani in Princess Kaiulani (2009).
Kilcher was born in Schweigmatt, Baden-Württemberg, West Germany (present-day Germany).
"Her name Q'orianka means ""Golden Eagle"" in Quechua."
She and her siblings were raised by their mother in Hawaii and California.
Her father is of Quechua-Huachipaeri descent from Peru.
Her mother, Saskia Kilcher, is a human rights activist of Swiss-German descent, born in Alaska and raised in Switzerland.
Q'orianka has two brothers, Kainoa Kilcher and Xihuaru Kilcher, who both work as actors and stunt performers.
"Kilcher's maternal grandfather was Ray ""Pirate"" Genet, a Swiss-born mountaineer who later immigrated to the United States."
Her first-cousin once removed is Jewel, a Grammy-nominated singer.
The founding patriarch of their family in Alaska, Yule Kilcher, was originally from Switzerland.
He was elected as a member of the Alaska Senate and served as a delegate to the Alaskan constitutional conference.
When Kilcher was two years old, she and her mother moved to Kapaʻa, Hawaii, where her brother Kainoa was born.
Her father, from whom she is estranged, was absent for much of her life.
Growing up in Hawaii, Kilcher was inspired by the local culture and started hula dancing at the age of five.
She also trained in Tahitian dance and West African, as well as ballet, hip hop and modern dance.
In 1997, Kilcher won Ballet Hawaii's Young Choreographer Award at age seven.

At the age of six years, Kilcher was the first child to study classical voice at the University of Hawaii with Laurance Paxton.
In 1999, her mother moved the family to California.
Kilcher started to sing and dance for tourist donations, busking on the Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica.
At the age of nine, Kilcher was cast as Choire Who in Ron Howard's How the Grinch Stole Christmas.
She was 12 when she received a full scholarship to the Musician's Institute in Hollywood, where she studied vocal performance, music theory and song-writing.
She also studied martial arts and stunts: she is an accomplished Blackbelt in Wushu, Kung Fu and a Stunt performer and has trained at the National Wushu Training Center and Impact Stunts.
At age 14, Q'orianka portrayed Pocahontas in the Academy Award-nominated motion picture The New World (2005), directed by Terrence Malick.
Her performance was critically acclaimed and won her the National Board of Review's best breakthrough performance of 2006, the 2006 Alma Award for best Latin American actress in a feature film, and numerous other award nominations.
The film was released in December 2005 to mixed reviews.
The film was a critical success, receiving several positive reviews and award nominations, but it was shown in only 811 theatres worldwide.
It yielded a relatively low box office gross.
In the summer of 2006, Kilcher began filming the independent film The Power of Few, which she produced through her own production company, Entertainment On-Q.
She played the title role in the feature film Princess Kaiulani (2009).
The film, about the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy, was released in May 2010 to negative reviews.

Asclepiades was the earliest and most important of the convivial and erotic epigrammists.
Only a few of his compositions were intended as actual inscriptions, if any.
Other poems sing the praises of those poets whom he especially admired, but the majority of his work that has survived is love songs.
It is doubtful whether he is the author of all the epigrams (some 40 in number) which bear his name in the Greek Anthology.
He has been credited with creating the metre which bears his name, the Asclepiad metre.
The sole source for the known, unlacunaed epigrams of Asclepiades is the Greek Anthology.
Most of Asclepiades's epigrams appear in both of the two principal Byzantine epigram collections that constitute the Greek Anthology: the Palatine Anthology and the Planudean Anthology.
Epigrams xxxix and xliii appear only in the Planudean Anthology, which is the less complete of the two so far as the epigrams of Asclepiades are concerned, all the rest are in the Palatine Anthology.
Some papyri have been recovered that contain portions of known epigrams and portions of otherwise unknown epigrams attributed to Asclepiades.
Mimoblennius atrocinctus, the banded blenny, is a species of combtooth blenny found in the western Pacific and eastern Indian oceans.
This is a rare species in which the adults live along rocky coastline to a depth of  where they inhabit the abandoned tubes created by worms either alone or in loose aggregations.
Their eggs are demersal and adhere to the substrate by an adhesive pad or pedestal which is filamentous.
The larvae are planktonic and are frequently recorded from shallow waters near the coast.
It has been recorded from the Indian Ocean off Sri Lanka and Christmas Island while in the western Pacific it has been recorded and from southern Japan to Hong Kong.

Cahora-Bassa (previously spelled Cabora Bassa) is an HVDC power transmission system between the Cahora Bassa Hydroelectric Generation Station at the Cahora Bassa Dam in Mozambique, and Johannesburg, South Africa.
The system was built between 1974 and 1979 and can transmit 1920 megawatts at a voltage level of 533 kilovolts DC and 1800 Amperes.
Thyristor valves are used, which unlike most other HVDC schemes are mounted outdoors and not in a valve hall.
The valves are grouped into eight, 133 kV six-pulse bridges in series at each end.
The  long powerline runs through inaccessible terrain, so it is mostly built as monopolar lines  apart.
In case of a single line failure, transmission with reduced power is possible via the surviving pole and return through the earth.
Cahora-Bassa was out of service from 1985 to 1997 because of the Mozambican Civil War in the region.
The project was beset with technological challenges, most notable of these being the adoption of solid-state rectification devices in a large-scale commercial installation.
Mercury-arc valves had been the de facto standard for HVDC up to this time.
Cahora Bassa was the first HVDC scheme ordered with thyristor valves, though its operation was delayed.
Significant commercial hurdles, culminating in hearings at an International Arbitration Tribunal seated in Lisbon, in 1988, also had to be overcome.
Following a refurbishment exercise,  the scheme was put back into commercial operation in October 1997.
Between 2006 and 2009 the thyristor valves at the Apollo converter station were replaced by more modern water-cooled thyristor valves.
The Cahora-Bassa transmission project was a joint venture of the two electrical utilities, Electricity Supply Commission (ESCOM, as it was known prior to 1987), latterly Eskom, Johannesburg, South Africa and Hidroelectrica de Cahora Bassa (HCB), a firm owned 15% by the government of Portugal and 85% by Mozambique.
Equipment was constructed and supplied by ZAMCO, which was a consortium of AEG-Telefunken JV, Brown Boveri Company, and Siemens AG of Germany.
Brown Boveri subsequently became part of ABB and AEG subsequently became part of Alstom.
The commercial arrangements also included Electricidade de Moçambique (EDM) which took supply from Cahora Bassa through a wheeling arrangement with Eskom.
Effectively, Eskom supplied southern Mozambique (Maputo) from the then Eastern Transvaal at 132 kV with the sales deducted from the HCB supply to Eskom.
The tripartite agreement was suspended due to force majeure when the line from Cahora Bassa was unavailable in the 1980s.
The system was commissioned in three stages starting in March 1977 with four six-pulse bridges, and in full operation of eight bridges on March 15, 1979.
The power line runs from the Songo converter station, which is near the hydroelectric station and normally operates as a rectifier, to the Apollo converter station near Johannesburg, which normally operates as an inverter.
Each of the self-supporting steel towers along the route carries two bundles of four 565 square millimetre (1120 kcmil) cables, one per pole, and a single 117 square millimetre (231 kcmil) grounding conductor.
There are approximately 7,000 towers with an average span of .
The maximum span is  using reinforced towers.
Earth return for unipolar operation is provided by buried graphite electrodes at each station.
The DC line has smoothing reactors and surge arrester capacitors at each station.
Cahora Bassa was one of the first HVDC schemes built with thyristor valves from its inception.
Unusually, the thyristor valves are outdoor mounted.
In the original installation they were oil filled for both cooling and electrical insulation.
The only other HVDC scheme in the world equipped in this way from the outset was the first phase – now decommissioned – of the Shin Shinano frequency converter in Japan.
Each valve tank contains two valves, forming a double-valve connecting the two DC terminals to one single-phase, two-winding converter transformer.
Each six-pulse bridge contains three such tanks and hence each station contains 24 double-valves.
In the first phase of the project (4 bridges at each end) each valve contained 280 such thyristors in series with two in parallel – the largest number ever used in a single HVDC valve.
V each and only required 192 in series per valve – still a large number by modern standards – with two in parallel.
As a result, each converter station contained a total of 22,656 thyristors.
The thyristors also had poor transient overcurrent capability, so another unusual feature of the scheme was the existence of overcurrent diverters between the valves and transformers, although these were later decommissioned at the Apollo station.
AC filters tuned to the 5th, 7th, 11th and 13th harmonics of the 50 Hz power supply are installed at each station, approximately 195 MVAr at Apollo and 210 MVAr at Songo.
There are two PLC repeater stations: one at Gamaboi in South Africa and one at Catope in Mozambique.
After the civil war ended in 1992, one of the many effects of the decade of strife was the damage to the HVDC transmission lines.
Nearly all of the 4200 transmission line towers located on the  of line in Mozambique needed to be replaced or refurbished.
This work was started in 1995 and took until late 1997 to complete.
The system was restored to full power transmission capacity by 1998.
Subsequently, Eskom has commenced electricity supply to Mozambique at 400 kV, under terms similar to the original wheeling agreement, from the Arnot Power Station in Mpumalanga, via Swaziland.
The principal purpose of this infrastructure is to provide bulk electricity supplies to the Mozal Aluminium Smelter operated by BHP Billiton.
The Memorandum of Understanding, signed on 2 November 2007, means that Mozambique will by the end of 2007 be in charge of a project located on its soil but on which it had no control for the past 30 years due to contractual obligations with Portugal.
The new arrangement gives Mozambique 85 percent of the Cahora Bassa Hydroelectric (HCB) project while Portugal will retain only 15 percent.
The project has a capacity to produce 2,000 megawatts of electricity and is one of the main suppliers of power to the Southern African Power Pool.
Mozambique will, however, need to pay US$950 million to the Portuguese government as compensation for the post civil-war reconstruction and maintenance of the dam.
In 2006 a contract was awarded to ABB to replace the thyristor valves at the Apollo station.
At the same time, the AC filters were replaced.
"Northeast of Apollo Converter Station the poles of HVDC Cahora Bassa undercross several 400 kV AC lines at 25°54'58""S 28°16'46""E respectively 25°54'57""S 28°16'51""E in such a low altitude that the area under the line may not be walked on and is fenced in ."

What started Hara on his career as an animation creator was visiting an animation film company as part of his job hunting activities after graduating from Tokyo Designer Gakuin College (TDG).
He recklessly left the tour, an act normally forbidden for visitors, and then begged an artistic director to give him a job.
A few days later he returned with some continuity drawings he created, as requested.
As a result, he was introduced to a commercial film studio.
After working at the studio for eighteen months, he joined Shin-Ei Animation on the recommendation of the president Keijiro Kurokawa.
At Shin-Ei he began working on a TV series Kaibutsu-kun as a production manager, then was moved to Doraemon.
There for the first time he took on the role of animation director.
In working on Doraemon, he was influenced by the chief director Tsutomu Shibayama.
Since Hara admired Fujiko Fujio, Doraemon'''s original author, he worked hard and became known for improving quality.
He appeared in an animation magazine as a new director to look out for.
After Obake no Q Taro and Doraemon, he was chosen as chief director of Esper Mami and worked for this TV series for two and a half years.
When Esper Mami ended, he took a break for ten months.
Then he returned by working on 21 emon.
After 21 emon, he worked on Crayon Shin-chan.
"For ""Shin-chan"" he did direction and continuity both for the TV series and the movies, becoming director in October 1996."
The 2001 Crayon Shin-chan movie Crayon Shin-chan: The Storm Called: The Adult Empire Strikes Back earned critical praise, and raised his profile.
The following year's Crayon Shin-chan: The Storm Called: The Battle of the Warring States was commended by the Agency for Cultural Affairs.
As of 2012 Hara has begun shooting his first live-action film, Hajimari no Michi'', which was released in June,2013.
ANZAC Peace Park is a park in Albany in the Great Southern region of Western Australia.
It is located at the foot of the hill where York Street meets Princess Royal Drive.
Features found within the park include: a memorial wall, pier of remembrance, interpretive signage, lighting, landscaping, pathways and seating.
A small area of garden named Lone Pine Grove has been planted with Aleppo Pines, the same tree as found on Lone Pine ridge in Gallipoli providing a living connection between Albany and Gallpoli.
For many of the troops Albany would have been the last they saw of their homeland.
A commemorative service was held in the park, attended by 60,000 people with dignitaries such as the Australian Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, and the New Zealand Prime Minister, John Key, who both gave addresses as part of the ceremony.
The park was officially opened in 2010 and hosted its first Anzac Day later the same year.
The Peace Park is part of the 110 million Albany Waterfront Development managed by LandCorp that also included the Albany Entertainment Centre and marina.
The Western Australian Premier, Colin Barnett, announced in 2009 that the state government would provide 433,000 funding for the Peace Park.
Ogenne-Camptort is a commune in the Pyrénées-Atlantiques department in south-western France.
Graham George Willars known as Graham Willars (20 November 1939 - 20 September 1997) was a rugby union flanker who played a 338 games for Leicester Tigers from 1959 to 1987, he also coached the side from 1982–87 and was club president from 1991–93.
Willars made his Leicester debut as a 19 year old on 17 October 1959 against Cheltenham at Welford Road and played 21 times in his first season.
However competition for places was fierce and in 1960/61 he played only 5 times and did not feature at all in either 1961/62 or 1962/63.
Willars reappeared in the first team against Waterloo in December 1962 and was then a feature in the team for many years.
Willars was club captain in 1968/69 and then again in 1972/73.
Willars' career lasted 27 years and 169 days, spanning 1,154 Tigers games, the longest by both measures of any player for Leicester Tigers.
He featured as a player in a record 20 different seasons.
At 47 years and 135 days he is also the oldest player to play for the club.
Willars succeeded Chalkie White as Tigers' first team coach and lead the side from 1982–87 leading the side to the final of the 1982-83 John Player Cup, where the side lost to Bristol.
Asterope (minor planet designation: 233 Asterope) is a large main-belt asteroid that was discovered on 11 May 1883, by French astronomer Alphonse Borrelly at Marseille Observatory in Marseille, France.
The asteroid was named after Asterope (or Sterope), one of the Pleiades.
It is a rare T-type asteroid and has a relatively dark surface.
The spectrum of 233 Asterope bears a resemblance to Troilite, a sulfurous iron mineral found in most iron meteorites.
The Koli people are an ethnic Indian group in Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Karnataka and Jammu and Kashmir states.
There has historically been some difficulty in identifying people as Koli or as Bhil people in what is now the state of Gujarat.
"The two communities co-existed in the hills of that area and even today there is confusion regarding their identity, not helped, in the opinion of sociologist Arvind Shah, by there being ""hardly any modern, systematic, anthropological, sociological or historical study"" of the Kolis."
Sources from the medieval period suggest that the term koli was applied generically to lawless people, whilst British colonial studies considered it to be a vague collective noun for varied communities whose sole common feature was that they were inferior to the Kunbis.
At some stage, koli became accepted as a caste and thus superior to the tribal Bhils.
Records of Koli people exist from at least the 15th century, when rulers in the present-day Gujarat region noted their chieftains as being marauding robbers and dacoits.
Over a period of several centuries, some of them were able to establish petty chiefdoms throughout the region, mostly comprising just a single village.
Although not Rajputs, this relatively small subset of the Kolis claimed the status of the higher-ranked Rajput community, adopting their customs and intermixing with less significant Rajput families through the practice of hypergamous marriage, which was commonly used to enhance or secure social status.
There were significant differences in status throughout the Koli community, however, and little cohesion either geographically or in terms of communal norms, such as the establishment of endogamous marriage groups.
Through the colonial British Raj period and into the 20th century, some Kolis remained significant landholders and tenants, although most had never been more than minor landowners and labourers.
By this time, however, most Kolis had lost their once-equal standing with the Patidar community due to the land reforms of the Raj period.
During the later period of the Raj, the Gujarati Kolis became involved in the process of what has subsequently been termed sanskritisation.
At that time, in the 1930s, they represented around 20 percent of the region's population and members of the local Rajput community were seeking to extend their own influence by co-opting other significant groups as claimants to the ritual title of Kshatriya.
The Rajputs were politically, economically and socially marginalised because their own numbers — around 4 - 5 per cent of the population — were inferior to the dominant Patidars, with whom the Kolis were also disenchanted.
The Kolis were among those whom the Rajputs targeted because, although classified as a criminal tribe by the British administration, they were among the many communities of that period who had made genealogical claims of descent from the Kshatriya.
The Rajput leaders preferred to view the Kolis as being Kshatriya by dint of military ethos rather than origin but, in whatever terminology, it was a marriage of political expedience.
In 1947, around the time that India gained independence, the Kutch, Kathiawar, Gujarat Kshatriya Sabha (KKGKS) caste association emerged as an umbrella organisation to continue the work begun during the Raj.
The relevance of the Kshatriya label in terms of ritual was diminished by the practical actions of the KKGKS which, among other things, saw demands for the constituent communities to be classified as Backward Classes in the Indian scheme for positive discrimination.
Kshatriyas would not usually wish to be associated with such a category and indeed it runs counter to the theory of Sanskritisation, but in this instance, it suited the socio-economic and political desires.
By the 1950s, the KKGKS had established schools, loan systems and other mechanisms of communal self-help and it was demanding reforms to laws relating to land.
It was also seeking alliances with political parties at the state level; initially, with the Indian National Congress and then, by the early 1960s, with the Swatantra Party.
By 1967, the KKGKS was once again working with Congress because, despite being a haven for Patidars, the party leadership needed the votes of the KKGKS membership.
The Kolis gained more from the actions of the KKGKS in these two decades than did the Rajputs, and Jaffrelot believes that it was around this time that a Koli intelligentsia emerged.
Ghanshyam Shah, a professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University, describes the organisation today as covering a broad group of communities, from disadvantaged Rajputs of high prestige to the semi-tribal Bhils, with the Kolis in the middle.
"He notes that its composition reflects ""a common economic interest and a growing secular identity born partly out of folklore but more out of common resentment against the well-to-do castes""."
The Kolis of Gujarat remained educationally and occupationally disadvantaged compared to communities such as the Brahmins and Patidars.
Their many Jātis include the Bareeya, Khant and Thakor, and they also use Koli as a suffix, giving rise to groups such as the Gulam Koli and Matia Koli.
Some do not refer to themselves as Koli at all.
Koli name appear in the central lists of Other Backward Classes maintained by the National Commission for Backward Classes, although at least one is also in part recognised as a Scheduled Tribe.
These classifications have been in force since at least 1993.
The Government of India classified the Koli community as Scheduled Caste in the 2001 census for the states of Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.
While the Koli are mostly Hindu, in Mumbai, Converted Native Christians include autochthonous Koli East Indian Catholics, who were converted by the Portuguese during the 16th century.
Robert Coulter (1891 – 31 December 1945) was a New Zealand politician of the Labour Party.
Born in 1891 in Christchurch and died December 1945, during which time Robert Coulter represented the Waikato electorate from 1935 to 1938, when he was defeated by National's Stan Goosman.
He settled in Te Aroha in 1904 and was a member of the Te Aroha Borough Council for more than 20 years, and had been for many years Mayor, when re-elected MP in 1943.
He was associated for a number of years with the Northern Athletic Union, the Thames Harbour Board and the Te Aroha Fire Board.
He then represented the Raglan electorate from 1943 to 1945, when he died.
He was succeeded by Hallyburton Johnstone of National in 1946.
He was to stand in Raglan in the cancelled 1941 election.
Robert Coulter was elected twice in rural electorates that usually returned Reform or National MPs.
The Bristol Type 72 Racer was a British racing monoplane designed by Wilfrid Thomas Reid and built by the Bristol Aeroplane Company at Filton, England.
The Bristol Racer was built to demonstrate the capabilities of the Bristol Jupiter engine designed by Roy Fedden.
Detail design work was authorised on 5 December, and an order issued to the factory for a single aircraft on 23 January 1922.
The Bristol Racer was a single-engined mid-wing monoplane with, unusual for the time, a retractable undercarriage.
The 480 hp (360 kW) Bristol Jupiter IV radial engine was entirely enclosed within the circular-section fuselage, with an elaborate arrangement of ducts to channel cooling air over the cylinders.
A large spinner with a central opening to admit air, constructed of laminated wood with internal wire bracing was fitted.
The fabric-covered wings had composite steel-and-wood spars and were designed as cantilevers, without bracing wires, and were parallel-chord with raked tips and deep full-span ailerons, which accounted for about 20% of the wing's chord.
The undercarriage was operated by a handcrank and chain drive, the legs  being housed in channels in the fuselage and the wheels within the wing roots.
One aircraft was built in 1922 and registered G-EBDR on 27 June 1922.
Piloted by Cyril Uwins, it made its maiden flight early in July 1922.
This revealed control problems caused by twisting of the wing caused by the overlarge ailerons.
For the second fight, bracing wires were added to the wing, but immediately after takeoff on a second flight the spinner disintegrated, the debris causing damage to the wing covering, and the flight was restricted to a single circuit.
The first flight had taken place with the spinner unpainted:  it had subsequently been painted, and the additional weight of the paint had caused the  failure.
A third flight, without any spinner, revealed that there was still a problem with the ailerons.
An attempt to rectify this was made by fitting a device which produced a small control surface movement for small movements of the joystick, with the rate of control surface displacement progressively increasing as stick displacement was increased.
This device, which used a cam on the bottom of the joystick to displace a pair of rollers connected to the ailerons, worked on the ground but under flight loads the rollers were pulled out of contact with the cam, resulting in  loss of lateral control.
Uwins made yet another wide circuit in the aircraft and again managed a safe landing.
For the next flight the cam device was removed and the control issue addressed by reducing the area of the ailerons to around 40% of their original area.
At the same time a new spinner was fitted, this being designed to remain static.
Three further flights were made, during the last two of which the undercarriage was successfully operated.
Lieutenant-General Jacobus Verster  (1919–1981) was a South African military commander.
He was Chief of the Air Force from 1967 to 1975.
He was educated at Pretoria University and joined the Air Force in 1936 as a student pilot.
He was shot down in North Africa in 1942 and was taken prisoner.
Gladys Davis (born 29 July 1893, date of death unknown) was a British fencer.
Urastoma cyprinae is a turbellarian that infects the gills of numerous species.
It has been reported as free-living organism in marine mud and on algae.
Urastoma cyprinae is reported as an opportunistic mantle inhabitant on the gills of various bivalve species, including the clams Tridacna maxima and Tridacna gigas, and the mussels Mytilus edulis and Mytilus galloprovincialis.
However, the nature of the host-parasite relationship remains unknown.
They live and feed and grow in the mussels, but their complete life cycle stumped researchers because eggs were never observed in these hosts.
About 24 days later, the young hatch out (shown in the photo), make their way out of the cocoon and swim off to find new mussel hosts.
The adults sometimes appear to just die in the cocoons, but sometimes also were observed to escape from it themselves and head off to lay more eggs.
There are no known methods of prevention or control.
Urastoma cyprinae is negatively phototatic and is more attracted to oysters when compared to other mollusc species such as mussels and clams.
Urastoma cyprinae attaches its anterior end to gill filaments, presumably in a feeding posture, and arches its body back and forth, wagging its posterior end, which bears the terminal orogenital pore, within the mucus that flows over the gills.
Ingestion of foods is likely to be driven by the sphincters on the orogenital atrium.
Urastoma cyprinae exhibits a marked seasonal pattern, with the highest levels of infection occurring during the summer and autumn, coinciding with the highest abundance of juvenile worms in the gills, and the lowest in winter.
Histological examinations revealed prokaryotic infections within the digestive gland of both mussel specimens and in the digestive tract of Urastoma cyprinaeis.
In the worm Urastoma cyprinaeis, 2 types of microorganisms were observed within sub-segmentary cells, a Chlamydia-like organism (CLO) and a myco-plasma-like organism (MLO).
The CLO found in Urastoma cyprinaeis is the first infectious agent described in this species.
It exhibits some similarities with the Chlamydiales reported in marine invertebrates, but differs in the morphology of its elementary bodies.

Market integration occurs when prices among different locations or related goods follow similar patterns over a long period of time.
Groups of goods often move proportionally to each other and when this relation is very clear among different markets it is said that the markets are integrated.
Thus, market integration is an indicator that explains how much different markets are related to each other.
A marketer plays the role of an integrator in the sense that he collects feedback or vital inputs from other channel members and consumers and provides product solutions to customers by coordinating multiple functions of organization.

Commission of Fine Arts (CFA) is an independent agency of the federal government of the United States, and was established in 1910.
In accordance with the Old Georgetown Act, the CFA appoints the Old Georgetown Board.
The Old Georgetown Board has design review authority over all semipublic and private structures within the boundaries the Georgetown Historic District.
The CFA mandate does not apply to the United States Capitol, the Library of Congress, or the other properties and locations overseen by the Architect of the Capitol.
President George Washington granted the government of the District of Columbia the power to regulate architectural design and urban planning.
These powers were suspended by President James Monroe in 1822.
Legislation was proposed in Congress in 1897, but failed to pass because members of Congress wanted an advisory board rather than one which could deny Congress the ability to award commissions as part of the spoils system.
The commission's plan for development of the city, popularly known as the McMillan Plan, proposed the razing of all residences and other buildings on Lafayette Square and building tall, Neoclassical government office buildings with facades of white marble around the square to house executive branch offices.
It also proposed clearing large spaces north and south of the National Mall, realigning some streets, and constructing major new museums and public buildings along the Mall's length.
The commission also proposed significant expansion of the district's park system, the creation of a system of parkways, and extensive renovation and beautification of existing parks.
On January 11, 1909, a committee of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) asked President Theodore Roosevelt to establish an independent federal agency to advise the government on architecture, bridges, painting, parks, sculpture, and other artistic works requiring design.
Roosevelt wrote back the same day, agreeing to the proposal.
On January 19, 1909, Roosevelt issued Executive Order 1010, establishing a Council of Fine Arts.
He requested that the AIA name 30 individuals to the council, and he instructed the Cabinet to seek the council's advice in matters of architecture, building site selection, landscaping, painting, and sculpture.
The Council met only once, on February 9, 1909, during which it approved the site (suggested by the McMillan Commission) for the Lincoln Memorial.
William Howard Taft was inaugurated as President in March 1909.
Taft revoked Executive Order 1010 on May 21, 1909.
There are differing explanations for Taft's actions.
Historians Sue Kohler and Christopher Thomas state that Taft supported the idea of a fine arts commission, but wanted it to have a basis in legislation.
But a contemporary report in the Washington Post noted that the council was highly controversial, and Congress had passed legislation prohibiting the expenditure of funds for any federal body not established by law.
The newspaper said the legislation was intended to defund the Council of Fine Arts.
Later in 1909, Senator Elihu Root (R-NY) drafted legislation establishing an advisory commission of fine arts.
The House passed the legislation on February 9, 1910.
"The House bill made the members of the commission subject to approval by the Senate, gave their term of office as four years, and their qualifications as artists ""of repute""."
In addition to having an advisory capacity on all questions of art and design, the commission was given final say on the selection of sites for monuments and statues.
Root managed the House bill through the Senate.
Speaker Joseph Gurney Cannon opposed the bill, and it was bottled up the Committee on the Library.
But in mid-March, a group of renegade Republicans joined forces with Democrats to strip Speaker Cannon of much of his power.
The fine arts commission bill quickly passed through the committee and was brought up for a vote on the Senate floor.
The Senate amended the bill, and passed it on May 3, 1910.
One amendment, to bar statues of any person not dead 50 years, was turned down.
"The Senate changed the qualifications of the commissioners to seven ""well qualified judges of the fine arts""."
It struck the commission's authority to site monuments and statues, making the authority advisory only.
It also added fountains to the type of items covered by the act.
In a conference committee on May 9, the House conferees agreed to the Senate amendments.
They also won approval of the Senate conferees to remove the requirement that the commission members be approved by the Senate.
President Taft named the seven members of the commission on June 13, 1910.
Taft appointed architect Daniel Burnham to be the chairman.
The 1910 legislation establishing the CFA gave the commission the power to only provide advice on the siting of monuments and memorials.
In October 1910, President William Howard Taft issued Executive Order 1259 (October 25, 1910), which required that all new public buildings erected in the District of Columbia be reviewed by the CFA as well.
Harding on July 28, 1921, further expanded the CFA's review to the design of coins, fountains, insignia, medals, monuments, parks, and statues, whether constructed or issued by the federal government or the government of the District of Columbia.
The Commission of Fine Arts is composed of seven members, who are appointed by the President.
The appointments do not require Senate approval.
Commission members serve four-year terms, and are not term-limited.

Wheelchair fencing at the 2008 Summer Paralympics was held in the Fencing Gymnasium of the Olympic Green Convention Centre from 14 September to 17 September.
Fencers were given a classification depending on the type and extent of their disability.
The classification system allows fencers to compete against others with a similar level of function.
Wheelchairs were anchored to the ground during competition.
The five event types below were competed for both class A and class B, for a total of ten events.
There were 84 fencers (60 male, 24 female) from 19 nations taking part in this sport.
This ranking sorts countries by the number of gold medals earned by their fencers (in this context a country is an entity represented by a National Paralympic Committee).
The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals.
If, after the above, countries are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically.

Elisa di Rivombrosa is an Italian television series (partly inspired by the 1740 novel Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded) about a love story in 18th century Italy between Fabrizio Ristori, a young Italian Count, and his mother's maid, Elisa.
Elisa Scalzi is a poor but beautiful and determined young lady, who pleasantly takes care of the old Countess Agnese Ristori of Rivombrosa.
Anna Ristori, Agnese's daughter, is jealous of the privileged relationship Elisa has with the countess (who took her at her service as her lady companion although Elisa was only a maid).
The Countess's health gets worse and she keeps expressing her desire to see her son, the charming Count Fabrizio Ristori, who has been enlisted in the French army for the past 10 years.
"Elisa decides to communicate the Countess' desire to Fabrizio, so She writes him a letter and She signs herself as ""Elisa di Rivombrosa"" ."
As soon as Fabrizio gets her letter, he decides to come back home.
Before leaving, he's asked to deliver some important and confidential documents to a friend, Capitano Lombardi, who would be waiting for him on the way home.
Although Fabrizio managed to chasethe killers away , Captain Lombardi was seriously injured.
Just before dying, he hands Fabrizio the documents and asks him to personally deliver them to King Carlo Emanuele III.
Fabrizio then goes home to the beautiful Estate of Rivombrosa, where everyone is pleased to see him after so long.
When he meets Elisa, he's amazed by her beauty.
"Not knowing she's a maidservant, he mistakes ""Elisa di Rivombrosa"" for an aristocrat because she's smart and well educated."
He tries to seduce her, and Elisa realises she's seriously falling for him.
Fabrizio shocks everyone - his sister Anna and all the other nobles, well aware of the girl's un-aristocratic conditions - when he dares invite Elisa to dance with him at a ball in honour of his return.
Antonio Ceppi, a former noble man who lost all of his properties and his title after getting married with Lucia, a servant girl.
He's seriously worried about his wife, who can't be found, and asks the nobles to help him.
The Count, against everyone's will, decides to help Antonio to look for his wife.
Lucia is found dead in the lake : she committed suicide because she felt responsible for her husband's social downfall and wanted him to be happy and accepted by the Upper class.
Her desperate action makes Elisa confess her social position to Fabrizio, who really gets mad at her.
He starts to treat her roughly and rudely, trying several times to take advantage of her.
He even ends up locking her in a cellar, in order to subdue her.
When his mother is about to die, he releases Elisa.
Countess Agnese Ristori, who really loves the young girl, asks her son to take care of her.
After the death of the Countess, Elisa, still traumatized by Fabrizio's behaviour, decides to leave Rivombrosa and find a job somewhere else.
The Count, however, doesn't want to give up on the girl and persuades all the aristocrats in the neighbourhood not to hire her.
Because of this, Elisa decides to go back to the village, to live with her mother and sister.
On the way home, she is attacked by the drunken Count Giulio Drago (Fabrizio's best friend).
Elisa hits him with a stone and ends up in prison.
When Fabrizio is informed of it, he first tries to convince his friend Giulio to remove the charges against Elisa.
When his friend refuses to do so, Fabrizio goes to Turin to ask the king for Elisa's grace in exchange for the confidential documents.
When he's about to give them to Duke Ranieri, he understands that the duke is the one who once tried to steal them.
With an excuse, Fabrizio takes Elisa's grace and runs away from Turin.
Those documents, in fact, could be very compromising for a number of nobles: they're a list of the king's conspirators.
Meanwhile, Elisa, still in prison, meets the young witch Celeste, who becomes a good friend of hers.
When Fabrizio finally arrives in Rivombrosa, he finds out that Elisa is already out of prison and safe.
When she comes thank the Count for his gesture, she decides with Fabrizio's approval to start working again at the Estate of Rivombrosa as a governess for Emilia, Fabrizio's niece and Anna's daughter.
Fabrizio and Elisa are now getting closer and closer, and they're both falling in love with each other.
The problem, however, is Elisa's social condition.
Because of that, in fact, they can't get married.
Giulio Drago convinces Fabrizio to make her marry Angelo Buondio, a sweet servant boy who's always been in love with her, in order to make her become his mistress.
Disgusted by the proposal, Elisa firmly refuses.
Fabrizio declares his love for her in the garden, in front of all the servants, and explains that this is the only way possible for him to stay with her.
In that moment, the carriage of the marchioness Lucrezia Van Necker, Fabrizio's former lover, arrives and the count tries to make Elisa jealous by flirting with the marchioness in front of her.
Lucrezia is a beautiful but cruel aristocrat woman and, together with her lover, the duke Ranieri, is one of the conspirators who longs for the king's death.
After Fabrizio's attempts with Lucrezia, Elisa decides to accept Angelo's marriage proposal but still refuses to become the count's mistress.
After deciding to marry Angelo, Elisa is getting ready for the wedding.
Fabrizio is hurt by the girl's decision and, feeling like he lost her forever, he decides to leave for Turin with Lucrezia, who offers to help him deliver the documents to the king.
Fabrizio thinks that the woman's husband, the king's counselor, Marquise Bouville, is involved in the conspiracy.
What he doesn't know is that the name written on the list is Lucrezia's, and not her husband's.
In fact, she's plotting to help her lover steal the documents by misleading the Count Ristori : when he arrives in Turin, Fabrizio is captured.
He manages to escape but gets hurt and falls into a river.
Meanwhile, Elisa, who's about to get married, remembers Fabrizio's words and his declarations of love, and runs away from the church, leaving a heart-broken Angelo at the altar.
After escaping from her wedding, Elisa returns to Rivombrosa, where she is now avoided by everyone.
The girl tries to apologize to Angelo but he's so hurt that he can't even talk to her and decides to leave Rivombrosa forever.
Fabrizio, wounded, is rescued by two fishermen and is then taken back to Rivombrosa by Celeste, Elisa's friend from prison, who recognised him.
His health condition is critical.
Ceppi tries his best to save him, Fabrizio asks for Elisa.
Meanwhile, Celeste goes warn Elisa about Fabrizio's state, and the girl runs to the Count's Estate to be at his side.
Once Elisa reaches him, he asks her to hide the documents somewhere safe.
The girl is a little confused by his request, but still grants his wish, and hides the conspirators' list between the endpapers of Countess Agnese Ristori's favourite book.
Fabrizio is getting better and Elisa and him can't deny their feelings anymore.
Count's sister Anna is very worried and refuses to accept this socially dishonourable relationship.
When Lucrezia comes to visit Fabrizio, Anna explains all her worries to the marchioness.
Giulio Drago is one of the conspirators, and as soon as he's informed that Duke Ranieri tried to hurt his friend, he argues with Lucrezia and the Duke, and leaves the conspirators' meeting in which they plot to attack the king.
Meanwhile, Count Ristori is so in love with young Elisa that he even starts thinking about a possible marriage, which would eventually make him lose his title.
His friend Giulio, though, makes him think about Antonio Ceppi's condition and how his marriage ended, and Fabrizio gives up his idea.
He is then recalled up to the army.
He does not want to leave Rivombrosa because he doesn't want to leave Elisa, but when the girl still refuses to be his mistress, he lets her go, and leaves.
Elisa soon realizes she made a mistake and chases him, and the two end up making love.
The next morning, Anna bursts into her brother's bedroom and finds out Elisa is in bed with him.
Count Giulio Drago asks for Margherita Maffei's hand, a marchioness he's in love with and Elisa's good friend.
Margherita's father, however, is forced to refuse his proposal because, due to a bad investment, he has lost all his properties, and he can't provide an appropriate dowry for his daughter.
Rumors of Elisa's love affair with Count Fabrizio reach everyone's ears, including Elisa's mother's, who refuses to talk to her.
Elisa is upset but Fabrizio comforts her.
The two lovers decide to get married secretly in Rivombrosa and ask Father Tognino to celebrate the ceremony.
The old man accepts, but the Abbot Van Neker, disconcerted about such a wedding between a noble man and a maidservaint, decides to warn his cousin, the marchioness Lucrezia.
The jealous woman, still in love with Fabrizio, has Father Tognino killed.
The Father is found dead in the church by Fabrizio and Elisa, right before their wedding.
Fabrizio receives a proposal from Duke Ranieri to join the conspiration.
Fabrizio refuses, and the Duke tries to find out more about the documents: his guards, disguised as servants, pay the servant girl Bianca for information and she tells them to question Elisa.
During the play performed by a traveling theatrical troupe in Rivombrosa, which all the nobles attend, two of the Duke's men attack Elisa in order to get information about the documents.
She is saved by the arrival of Fabrizio, who fights and kills them.
Ludovico Maffei attempts suicide by poisonning himself, overwhelmed by the responsibility of having ruined his daughters lives.
Ceppi find him and try to save him.
Anna, who still cannot accept the love between Fabrizio and Elisa, goes to Turin to ask her friend, the beautiful Duchess Clelia Bussani, to try to seduce her brother.
Clelia, Anna's friend and the King's cousin, arrives at Rivombrosa and Fabrizio decides to go back to Turin with her, hoping to meet the king there and warn him on the conspiracy.
Clelia and Fabrizio get along quite well but Fabrizio remains faithful to Elisa.
Marquis Maffei, still sick from the poison he took, raves of the conspiracy to Margherita, who goes to Rivombrosa telling what she's heard.
Unfortunately Fabrizio is not in the palace, so Margherita tells everything to Elisa.
On the next day, Elisa goes to Turin to warn Fabrizio, and everythings happens very fast.
The Count is waiting with Clelia for the king, in her carriage.
Seeing the barrel of a gun at a window, he runs to prevent the killer from shooting the king, while Elisa yells to warn the king's guards.
Angelo, who now serves in the Royal Guard is badly injured when he tries to protect the king from the shooting.
Fabrizio, who did not manage to catch the killer, has to flee to avoid being caught because it looks as though he was the one who tried to shoot the king.
Clelia hides him in her carriage and Elisa and Fabrizio return to Rivombrosa together.
Elisa is still feeling sick and weak and Amelia starts to think that she could be pregnant.
Elisa notices that a little orphan boy, Martino has a birth mark on his shoulder similar to that which is on Fabrizio's shoulder.
Along with Amelia they come to the conclusion that the orphan is the result of a dissolute life he led after leaving Lucrezia van Necker 10 years ago.
Elisa tells her observations to Fabrizio and accuses him of not caring about his son.
Therefore, Fabrizio goes to buy Martino free and takes him to work in the stables.
Finally, Elisa tells Fabrizio that she is pregnant.
This makes the Count to decide not to expose their common happiness to any more risks and wants to return the list to Count Drago.
Elisa tells him that whatever he does will be right and tells that she and their unborn baby will wait for him.
Meanwhile, Anna's husband Fabrizio plans to incapacitate and take over the property.
They organize a special dinner, in which van Necker and other nobles are invited to confirm that Fabrizio is crazy since he wants to marry a servant.
Fabrizio understands what's going on and takes the opportunity to propose to Elisa.
She runs away when she sees the nobles' faces.
Fabrizio resolves to never again hide their feelings and views.
He wants to marry Elisa and let everybody know that he loves her.
The wedding arrangements start at the Palace.
Initially reluctant abbot van Necker agrees to marry them in the condition, however, that the bride and groom must find the two witnesses for the marriage.
The Marquis Maffei for fear of reprisals refuses.
Ceppi and Giulio agree to be the witnesses.
Anna goes to Lucretia for help.
The nobles arrive to the wedding ceremony but in the middle of it they all turn away from the young to mark their protest, only Clelia remains in place.
By showing that she accepts their relationship.
Fabrizio drives his sister Anna away from Rivombrosa after guessing that she was responsible for what happened at his and Elisa's wedding.
Exiled Anna moves out of the palace with her husband, and is forced to share their new place with his lover - Betta Maffei.
Fabrizio swears revenge against all the enemies of Elisa.
The only aristocracy, who shows their support for them is Lucrezia van Necker, who actually has her own good at stake too.
Elisa does not trust her, and her care grows when he learns that Lucrezia and Fabriozo were lovers in the past.
Margeritha Maffei enters the convent, according to the promise she made to God.
Meanwhile Lucrezia invites Fabrizio and Elisa to dinner with other nobles.
During this dinner Lucrezia sends men to Rivombrosa in order to steal the list.
But Elisa is not feeling too well and along with Fabrizio they return to Rivombrosa early.
At night, Lucrezia's men come to Rivombrosa after bribing Bianca to lead them to the library.
Along the way they kill one of the farmhands, that Martino finds and rushes to Fabrizio and Elisa's bedroom to tell what he has seen.
The men can't find the list and set the library on fire.
At the same moment there enters Fabrizio, who kills the two thugs.
Concerned about the prolonged absence of Fabrizio and about the noises she hears, Elisa leaves the bedroom with a knife.
Unfortunately she comes across with the man who escaped and fatally wounds him with the knife.
The man falls down the stairs taking Elisa with him.
Fabrizio finds Elisa and cries over worry for his beloved and the fate of their child.
Elisa after falling down stairs loses her child.
Her condition is critical.
Fabrizio calls her mother and sister to Rivombrosa.
Lucrezia also offers her assistance insidiously.
At the news of the attack on the palace Angelo returns to Rivombrosa, asking Fabrizio to rejoin his service.

The Mechanic is a 1972 American action thriller film which was directed by Michael Winner, produced by Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff, and written by Lewis John Carlino.
The film stars Charles Bronson, Jan-Michael Vincent, Keenan Wynn, and Jill Ireland.
The story follows Arthur Bishop (Bronson), a top assassin who takes under his wing Steve McKenna (Vincent), the ruthless and ambitious son of Harry McKenna (Wynn), the former head of the secret organization for which Bishop works.
It is noted for its opening, which features no dialogue for the first 16 minutes, as Bronson's character prepares to kill his current target.
Upon its release, the film received generally mixed reviews from critics but it was praised for its action scenes, acting and writing although the direction and the storytelling was criticized.
A remake of the same name was released on 2011, starring Jason Statham as Bishop and Ben Foster as McKenna.
The film was a financial success, and spawned a sequel, Mechanic: Resurrection, which was released five years later.
"Arthur Bishop (Charles Bronson) is a ""mechanic"" (a top assassin)."
He works exclusively for a secret international organization that has very strict rules.
Bishop regularly listens to classical music, has an art collection, and is a connoisseur of fine wines.
However, he is forced to live alone - he cannot show emotions or trust people.
Bishop is under constant emotional pressure, so much so that he is prescribed anti-depressants for depression.
One day he is temporarily hospitalized after he loses consciousness due to the stress.
Bishop pays a call girl (Jill Ireland) to have a simulated romantic social and sexual relationship, including her writing fake love letters to him.
"When Bishop is assigned one of the organization's heads, ""Big Harry"" McKenna (Keenan Wynn), he shoots at Big Harry while making him think that the shots are being fired by a hidden sniper."
Harry, who Bishop knows has a weak heart, runs up a steep incline, which triggers a heart attack.
Bishop then finishes Harry off by smothering him.
At Big Harry's funeral, Bishop runs into Harry's narcissistic, ruthless and ambitious son Steve (Jan-Michael Vincent).
Steve is intrigued by Bishop and seeks to find out more about him.
Bishop is also intrigued, as he realizes that Steve has a personality suited for being a hit man, and plays along.
However, Bishop failed to get his superiors' prior consent for the arrangement.
Following a messy assassination conducted by Bishop and Steve, the organization warns Bishop that his irresponsible choice to involve Steve has been interpreted as selfish behavior.
The organization then gives Bishop an urgent mission, this time in Italy.
Once again, Bishop involves Steve in the new plan, but just before they leave Bishop happens to find among Steve's belongings a file containing information about Bishop.
This file is very similar to the files Bishop prepared for his targets.
Nevertheless, Bishop allows Steve to go with him to Italy.
In Italy, Bishop and Steve approach a boat where their intended victim is supposed to be, but it becomes apparent that this was a trap and they are the real targets.
Bishop and Steve are ambushed, but they manage to kill all their would-be assassins.
His apprenticeship apparently complete, Steve shares a celebratory bottle of wine with Bishop, having coated the latter's glass with brucine, a colorless and deadly alkaloid.
When Bishop realizes that he has been poisoned, he asks Steve if it was because Bishop had killed Steve's father.
Steve responds that he had not realized his father was murdered.
"Steve taunts Bishop, saying ""You said every man has his jelly spot."
Steve goes on to reveal that he was not acting on orders to kill Bishop.
Steve returns to Bishop's home to pick up the Ford Mustang he had left there.
"He finds a note affixed to the rear-view mirror, which reads: ""Steve, if you read this it means I didn't make it back."
It also means you've broken a filament controlling a 13-second delay trigger.
As Steve frantically reaches for the door handle, the car explodes.
Monte Hellman was originally scheduled to direct The Mechanic.
He and screenwriter Lewis John Carlino adapted Carlino's then-unpublished novel and worked on the script for several weeks before producers switched studios and hired Michael Winner to direct.
In Carlino's original script, the relationship between Arthur Bishop and Steve McKenna was explicitly gay.

Fukushima Prefecture, and  consists of present-day Niigata Prefecture.
Officially the expressway is referred to as the Tōhoku-Ōdan Expressway Iwaki Niigata Route.
The route of the expressway connects the coastlines of the Pacific Ocean and the Japan Sea by traversing the mountainous interior of the Tōhoku region.
The expressway commences at a junction with the Jōban Expressway in Iwaki, Fukushima and follows a northwesterly course to the city of Kōriyama, where it intersects with the Tōhoku Expressway.
The expressway continues its course through the historic Aizu region, with Mount Bandai viewable to the north and Lake Inawashiro viewable to the south.
The route then enters Niigata Prefecture and eventually terminates at a junction in Niigata City with the Hokuriku Expressway and Nihonkai-Tōhoku Expressway.
The route parallels the East Ban'etsu Line and West Ban'etsu Line of East Japan Railway Company and National Route 49 for much of its length.
The first section of the expressway was opened to traffic in 1990 and the entire route was completed in 1997.
The route was originally 2 lanes only, one in each direction.
